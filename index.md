### CPSC 120

* Lab 3 [Repository Link](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-03-james-and-ryley.git)

    The reason I chose lab 3 as one of my favorite lab assgiments for this semester is because I thought it was pretty fun trying to calculate the pizza. I learned alot in this lab by using mathematical operations, such as calculating the radius from the diameter and then using that to find the area of a circle. This showcases how programming can handle complex mathematical tasks.

* lab 5 [Repository Link](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-05-jesus-and-james.git)

    I really enjoyed lab 5 because it was kind of challenging for me. During this lab I had to caculate the area of a rectangle for part 1, and for part 2 I had to convert decimal feet to feet & inches. I think this lab also made me get a feel on how to use functions, as functions help organize code making it easier to understand. 

* lab 8 [Repository Link](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-08-james-and-adam-s.git)

    Lab 8 is another one of my favorite labs this semseter because I thought it was the most interesting to me. Working with the sandwhich.cc file was also pretty fun to me cause it seemed like I was playing a game creating my own sandwhich. With both part 1 and part 2 these labs focus on data processing, handling command line inputs, handling errors, and making effective use of the C++ standard library. They show how tools that interact with users through command line inputs and carry out useful computations.
